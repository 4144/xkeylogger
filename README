--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Info:

    xkeylogger intercepts human readable keyboard events (and also some useful
    special keys like backspace) and dumps the resulting translated characters
    to standard output; it also keeps track of the currently focused window.

Dependencies:

    libxi-dev (>= 1.3)

Build:

    $ make

Usage:

    Dump keystrokes to a file (quit with Control-C or SIGTERM):

        $ xkeylogger > key.log
